# **App Name**: Hideaway

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Image Upload: Allow users to upload an image which will be used as the cover image for encoding/decoding a secret message.
- Text Input: Text Input: Allow users to input a secret message. Provide reasonable length limits to prevent errors during the encoding process.
- Encoding: Encoding: Implements the steganography algorithm to hide the text message within the image.
- Download: Download: After encoding, provide a way to download the new image with the hidden data.
- Decoding: Decoding: Allow users to upload an image to reveal a secret message, and then display it on the screen.
- Cover Story Generation: AI Tool: Employ generative AI to generate realistic-sounding but misleading "cover stories" to accompany the image when sharing. The user selects a desired general topic for the cover story, and the AI produces the text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#3F704D), evokes nature, concealment, and secrets.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0F4F0), provides a muted backdrop.
- Accent color: Rusty orange (#A8511C), for contrast and visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying any encoding/decoding-related code snippets.
- Use simple, minimalist icons representing concepts like lock/unlock, eye, and file download/upload.
- Subtle animations when encoding/decoding is complete. For instance, an animated magnifying glass over the picture while the message is being decoded.
